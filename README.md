# PHP-OOP-Quickstart
PHP Object oriented quickstarter

Quickstart is a PHP object-oriented creator program. 
After setting the parameters of your project, Quickstart will generate the classes, action files and template pages you need. 
Quickstart does not use a database, but rather settings and project files so that it can be used without connecting to the 
project server. To create the class, action, and view files, connection to the project server is required. 
These are the different functions of Quickstart:

SQL Creator
SQL Designer
PHP Class Generator
List page generator
Edit Form page generator
Action file generator

Also included is a project base to get the foundation of your project up and running.
Quickstart supports several different project formats:

Standard (no framework)
Bootstrap
HTML5 Boilerplate (coming soon)
Angular JS (coming soon)
Skeleton (coming soon)
Foundation (coming soon)
jQuery Mobile (coming soon)
Or, create your own format.
